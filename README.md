# Phishing URL Detection

## Overview

Phishing attacks are a significant cybersecurity threat, targeting users by tricking them into providing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and financial details. This project focuses on developing an AI-powered phishing URL detection system using machine learning and natural language processing techniques.

The system utilizes a combination of heuristic-based features, WHOIS domain data, and transformer-based deep learning models to classify URLs as either phishing or legitimate. The project also features an interactive web-based interface using Gradio for real-time phishing detection.

## Features

- **Advanced Machine Learning Techniques**: Utilizes NLP-based transformers for analyzing URL structures.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts lexical, host-based, and content-based features from URLs.
- **WHOIS Data Integration**: Retrieves domain registration details to check for suspicious activity.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Provides instant results through an easy-to-use web interface.
- **Visualization Tools**: Includes plots and metrics to analyze model performance.
- **Customizable Model**: Supports fine-tuning of parameters and model retraining with new data.

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed (recommended version 3.8 or above). Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install gradio python-whois transformers torch numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn joblib tqdm requests
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phishing-url-detection.git
cd phishing-url-detection
```

### Running the Application

To start the phishing URL detection system, run:

```bash
python phishing_detection.py
```

Or, if using a Jupyter Notebook:

1. Open `phishing_detection.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Execute the cells sequentially.

## How It Works

The detection model follows a multi-step approach:

1. **Feature Extraction**: The input URL is processed to extract various characteristics such as:
   - URL Length, Special Characters, Subdomains
   - Domain Age, Registrar Information (from WHOIS Lookup)
   - Presence of IP addresses in the URL
   - HTTPS vs HTTP usage
2. **Text Analysis**: Using TF-IDF and NLP techniques, the text content of URLs is analyzed.
3. **Model Prediction**: The extracted features are passed to a machine learning classifier (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or Transformer-based models) for classification.
4. **Result Display**: The model outputs whether the URL is phishing or legitimate, along with confidence scores.

## Example Usage

1. Open the Gradio web interface.
2. Enter a suspicious URL in the input field.
3. Click the "Check URL" button.
4. The model will analyze and display the results.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a combination of:

- Open-source phishing datasets (e.g., PhishTank, OpenPhish)
- Legitimate URL datasets from Alexa and Common Crawl
- Custom labeled data collected through web scraping

## Model Performance

The phishing URL detection model has been evaluated on various metrics including:

- **Accuracy**: Measures overall correctness.
- **Precision & Recall**: Evaluates phishing vs legitimate classification performance.
- **F1-Score**: Balances precision and recall for reliable evaluation.
